# Fix Apollo Client Error

## Problem
The error "Export ApolloProvider doesn't exist in target module" occurs because Apollo Client version 4.0.7 is incompatible with React 19 and Next.js 15.5.3.

## Solution
I've updated the package.json to use compatible versions. Now you need to:

### 1. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
```bash
cd courier-sync-feature3-frontend
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

### 2. Reinstall dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Alternative: If the above doesn't work, try updating manually
```bash
npm install @apollo/client@^3.8.8 graphql@^16.8.1 @radix-ui/react-select@^2.1.2
```

## Updated Versions
- @apollo/client: ^3.8.8 (was ^4.0.7)
- graphql: ^16.8.1 (was ^16.11.0)
- @radix-ui/react-select: ^2.1.2 (added - was missing)

## Why This Fixes It
- Apollo Client v4 is very old and doesn't export ApolloProvider correctly with newer React versions
- Apollo Client v3.8.8 is the latest stable version that works with React 19
- GraphQL v16.8.1 is compatible with this Apollo Client version

## After Installation
Once you run `npm install`, the Apollo Provider error should be resolved and you can run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
